This folder contains a test harness to run the mocha tests in the browser. You need to start the test server with `node bin/start-test-server.js`, which serves the index.html page as well as the REST API that is used in some of the tests. Then open the URL `http://localhost:2808/static/browser/test` and watch the mocha tests run. Alternatively, just start `grunt`, which starts the test server, runs the tests via PhantomJS and stops the test server again.
